/**

Class LongSizeValidation
Provides a constraint validator for the LongSize annotation.
{@link LongSizeValidation} is a class that implements the {@link ConstraintValidator} interface, which allows it to be used by the validation framework to validate long values annotated with the LongSize annotation.
The {@link #initialize(LongSize)} method is called when the validator is first applied, it assigns the max field with the value provided in the annotation and it also calls the super.initialize method
The {@link #isValid(Long, ConstraintValidatorContext)} method is called by the validation framework to check if the long value being validated meets the constraints defined in the LongSize annotation.
It converts the given Long value to String, and check the length of the string representation of the value against the max value, if the length of the string representation is less than or equal to max it returns true, else it returns false.
